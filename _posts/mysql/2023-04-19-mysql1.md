<https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/submissions/950803509/>

### 문제설명

Table: `Customers`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.

```

Table: `Orders`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.

```

Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output:
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```
