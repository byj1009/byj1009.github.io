## 176.Second Highest Salary
<https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/>

### 문제설명

Table: `Employee`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

```

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report `null`.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```
