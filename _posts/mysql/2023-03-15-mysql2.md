## 182.Duplicate Emalis
<https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-emails/>

### 문제설명

Table: `Person`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.   
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

```

Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.   
Return the result table in **any order**.   
The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output:
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.
```

Email중에서 중복되는 것을 조회한다.

**풀이**
```SQL
SELECT email AS "Email"
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING count(email) >= 2;
```

email의 count 갯수가 2이상인 것으로 간단히 필터링 가능하다.

**다른풀이**
```SQL
#1.
SELECT e.Name AS Employee
FROM Employee e
JOIN Employee m ON e.ManagerId = m.Id
WHERE e.Salary > m.Salary

#2.
select DISTINCT email from Person group by email having count(email) > 1;
```
